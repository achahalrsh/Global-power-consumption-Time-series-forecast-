# Global-power-consumption-Time-series-forecast-
Developed a multivariate multistep time series forecasting model using lagged variables to predict the electricity power consumption for next 7 days. Cleaned the data and performed data exploration and visualisation using matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2 and created new variables for the date time indexed dataset based on seasonality, time of the day and day of the week etc. Trained the model on various machine learning algorithms including SVR, LR , Random Forest , XGBoost and got a RMSE of approximately 280.
